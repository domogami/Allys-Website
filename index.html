            <h2> Artist Statement</h2>

        
            <p>  I am an artist. I work across different mediums. Ranging from photography to painting, drawing and scultpure, but not limited to creating poetry and music. </p> 

        
            <p> I would say it began with drawing when I was a young child. I remember being in teh third grade and I drew the recently elected president Obama. I remember my drawing won some sort of prize and was hung in te office for the rest of the year. I kept drawing from there and only got better with age. I started to take it mroe seriously towards the end of high school realizing I can do comssioned work. It was then that my father exposed that he had once worked for disney in the animation department and he too was an artist. Learning this so late was extrememly surpring but made me feel more connected with him and I have only been trying to better my skills since. </p>
